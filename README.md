# Portfolio-Webpage
It's a website that I am creating to display my work, skills, and achievements in one central place. I will include examples of projects I've worked on, such as coding projects, design pieces, or writing samples. This webpage helps me present myself to potential employers, clients, or anyone interested in knowing more about what I can do.
